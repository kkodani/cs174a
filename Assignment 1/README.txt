Assignment 1

My Setup:
Computer: Macbook Pro (2010)
OS: Mac OSX 10.8.5
Browser: Firefox 33.0
Environment: TextEdit (a simple text editor for mac)

What I did do:
I basically copied the code from the book and from the TA notes to get the basics working
(i.e. the html file setup, the shaders, buffers etc).
The book also had the code used to generate a Sierpinski triangle, which I copied
into the javascript file.  Then I changed the starting coordinates to (-0.5, -0.5),
(0.5, -0.5) and (0.0, 0.5) as specified.

What I did not do:
I did not implement any of the extra credit.
